# INTENT.md — DSA Visualizer

*Goals-driven autonomous iteration*

## Goals

1. **Learn by Seeing** — Every algorithm has clear, step-by-step visualization. Understand what's happening at each step, not just the final result.

2. **Interview Ready** — Complexity analysis, edge cases, "when to use", interview tips for each algorithm. The context you need to ace technical interviews.

3. **Comprehensive Coverage** — All the classics: sorting, searching, trees, graphs, dynamic programming. Interconnected so you can explore related concepts.

## Constraints

```yaml
auto_merge: [lint, types, tests, a11y, docs, new-algorithms-with-tests]
needs_review: [UI changes, new visualizer types, architecture changes]
never_auto: [AI tutor prompts, learning content tone]
```

## Next Actions
<!-- Auto-populated by iteration loop -->

## Completed
- [x] 2026-02-20: a11y warnings fixed — 58 → 1 (goal 1: better UX)
