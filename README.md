by concept or data structure utilized. I have also included resources I found
helpful during my interviewing journey.

## Credit
Much credit must be given to Haseeb Qureshi and [his blogpost](https://haseebq.com/how-to-break-into-tech-job-hunting-and-interviews/) on
how to break into the tech industry. This was a major inspiration in my starting
of this guide!

## Todo
1. Convex Hull
2. Update merge & merge sort
3. Shortest Path in Graphs
   1. Bellman Ford
   2. A*
4. 3 way quick sort (djikstra approach) - used to speed up quicksort when there
   are duplicate keys
5. standardize doc strings (low priority)
   1. problem statement
   2. tests (doctests) (understanding check)
   3. basic algorithm description
   4. pseudocode (if necessary)
   5. complexity analysis
6.  build out more robust testing of algorithms (medium priority)
   6. build out test suite to run all tests at once
   7. subfolder in each category
      1. {algo_name}_test.py
7. remove duplicate classes and use imports
   1. Tree classes (make TreeNode.py)
