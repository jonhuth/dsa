## Credit
Much credit must be given to Haseeb Qureshi and [his blog post](https://haseebq.com/how-to-break-into-tech-job-hunting-and-interviews/) on how to break into the tech industry. This was a major inspiration in my starting of this guide!

## Todo
1. Convex Hull
2. Fix DepthFirstOrder (used for topological sort)
3. update both hash table and hash set implementations using dynamic array
4. Update merge & merge sort
5. 3 way quick sort (djikstra approach) - used to speed up quicksort when there are duplicate keys
6. convert all files with uses of camelCase to snake_case (low priority)
7. standardize doc strings (low priority)
   1. problem statement
   2. tests (doctests) (understanding check)
   3. basic algorithm description
   4. pseudocode (if necessary)
   5. complexity analysis
8.  build out more robust testing of algorithms (medium priority)
   6. subfolder in each category
      1. {algo_name}_test.py
