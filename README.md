## Resources
1. Books
2. Blogs
3. Casual Reading
4. Podcasts
5. Practice Sites
6. Mock Interview Sites

## Todo
1. Convex Hull
2. Update merge & merge sort
3. 3 way quick sort (djikstra approach) - used to speed up quicksort when there are duplicate keys
4. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) - research applications
5. Topological Sort
6. convert all files with uses of camelCase to snake_case (low priority)
7. standardize doc strings (low priority)
   1. problem statement
   2. tests (doctests) (understanding check)
   3. basic algorithm description
   4. pseudocode (if necessary)
   5. complexity analysis
8. build out more robust testing of algorithms (medium priority)
   1. subfolder in each category
